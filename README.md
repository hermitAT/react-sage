# LHL Final Project - Cocktail Sage

## Overview

Cocktail Sage is a website where you can browse or search existing recipes, add their own twist to them or create a new recipe from scratch!

#
# Main Features

### Ingredients List
- Cocktail Sage uses a database full of the most popular and widely used ingredients for cocktail recipes. Each ingredient has characteristics regarding alcoholic content, flavour and are sorted into categories to allow users to navigate through these lists with ease.

#
### Creating Recipes
- Users can create recipes from the available ingredients, making sure to include an image, brief description and instructions for how they are to be made. When a new recipe is created, the expected strength of the cocktail is calculated, given the volumes and characteristics of the ingredients used.

#
### Editing and reMixing Recipes
- Users can edit their existing recipes and change any number of details about them, adding new ingredients or changing the image or text-based descriptors. In addition, a user can use an existing recipe as a template when creating a new recipe.
- The user can then make any number of changes to their 'reMix', and they are able to navigate back to the recipe they used as a template directly on the page for their new recipe, allowing users to see the inspiration for this new creation and view the changes over time with each new 'reMix'.

#
### Home Page
- Guests are greeted with a randomly selected Cocktail of the Day as well as some randomly selected trivia regarding alcohol or cocktails.
- Guests are also shown the best rated alcoholic cocktail and non-alcoholic cocktail.

#
### NavBar
- The NavBar contains buttons to navigate back home, to go the create page, or to go to the search page. Active user information and a link to view their page or logout exist in the far right of the navbar.
- There is also a dropdown menu that will allow users to browse recipes by their chosen method of filtration (ex. by flavour, by strength or by a given ingredient).
